# 🚀 Hey, I'm Rafay Hingoro!  

### 💻 Software Engineer | Open-Source Enthusiast | Web Dev Geek  

I love building things that live on the internet—whether it's a slick web app, an open-source tool, or just a fun side project. I’m all about writing **clean, efficient code** and constantly pushing the limits of what’s possible with modern web technologies.  

### 🚀 What I’m Up To:  
- 🏗️ **Building** scalable, high-performance web apps  
- 📜 **Writing** clean & maintainable code (because future-me deserves it)  
- 🎨 **Exploring** new tech stacks, because why not?  
- 🎯 **Contributing** to open source and sharing knowledge  

### 🔥 Currently Geeking Out Over:  
- 🧠 AI & Machine Learning (because robots are cool)  
- ⛓️ Blockchain & Web3 (still figuring out if we’re in a simulation)  
- 🚀 Performance optimization (making things faster = fun)  

I’m always learning, experimenting, and looking for the next exciting challenge. If you’re into building cool things, let’s connect and make something awesome together!
