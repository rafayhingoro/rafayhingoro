# Hi, I’m Rafay Hingoro 👋

### Software Engineer | Web Developer | Open-Source Advocate

I am a UK-based software engineer who loves building user-friendly, high-performance web applications. I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and contributing to open-source to make the web a richer place.

### What I Work On  
* Building scalable web applications with modern technologies  
* Architecting reliable systems with efficiency and clarity  
* Exploring new frameworks and languages to keep pushing myself  
* Sharing my knowledge through open-source and blog posts  

### What I’m Exploring  
* Transitioning codebases to **Go** — I recently wrote about why I switched from PHP to Go for speed, concurrency, and cleaner code.   
* **AI** and machine learning — because more smart tools are better tools  
* **Blockchain / Web3** — there's something exciting about decentralisation  
* Performance tuning and system scalability — I love fast, efficient software  

### Selected Projects & Experience  
On my [archive page] I showcase a wide variety of past projects, including:   
- Websocket Chat using PHP   
- AI-powered web apps built with Laravel, MySQL, and Python   
- Legacy / large-scale systems migrated to more maintainable stacks   

I’ve also written insightful blog posts:  
- *Moving My Code to Go* — my journey switching to Go, and why it really makes a difference.   
- *React.js – A Javascript Library for Building UI* — a deep dive into React’s architecture and its benefits.   

### Why I Do This  
I believe software should be **useful, fast, and clean**. I’m always curious, always learning, and always thinking about how to make things better — whether through code, community, or collaboration.

If you are building something innovative, or you want to work together on open-source / web applications, I’d love to talk.
